### Hi there 👋

🏡 &nbsp;&nbsp; I am a Senior Research Scientist at Adobe Research.

🎓 &nbsp;&nbsp; I am interested in audiovisual cross-modal media sensing and synthesis using tools from computer vision, graphics, deep learning, and HCI. 

🔎 &nbsp;&nbsp; I’m always looking for interns and collaborators to work on research projects leading to publications/patents/product features. Please feel free to reach out to learn more.
