### Hi there 👋

🏡 &nbsp;&nbsp; I am a Senior Research Scientist at Adobe Research.

🎓 &nbsp;&nbsp; I create new interactions for video creation and authoring workflow. I am a heavy user of deep learning, LLMs, and GenAI.  

🔎 &nbsp;&nbsp; I’m always looking for interns and collaborators to work on research projects leading to publications/patents/product features. Please feel free to reach out to learn more.

📫 &nbsp;&nbsp; How to reach me -- see http://dingzeyu.li/.
